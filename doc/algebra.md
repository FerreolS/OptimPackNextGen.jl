# Algebra

To solve large scale optimization problems in a unified way, OptimPackNextGen
manipulates the unknowns of the problems, the so-called "variables", at an
abstract level requiring that a few methods be implemented to manipulate the
variables of interest.  Other values can be scalar reals of type
`OptimPackNextGen.Float` (an alias to `Cdouble` which is itself an alias to
`Float64`) or integers of type `Int` (the default integer type of Julia which
is suitable for indexing arays).


## Variables and Vector Spaces

The "variables" are the unknowns of the considered inverse problem.  Variables
in OptimPackNextGen belong to so-called "vector spaces" which can be anything
needed to store the variable values.  A variable instance is typically used as
a template to represent any variable of the same vector space.  The type of a
variable is not sufficient (for instance a Julia array type is only specified
by the type of its elements and its number of dimensions, whereas all
dimensions must be specified to build a similar array).

The values of a variables may have any type (or may even have each different
types).  Vector spaces implement the following methods:

* `length{T}(x::T)` to give the number of components in variable `x`;

* `vcreate{T}(x::T)` to create a new variable of the same space as `x`;

* `vcopy!{T}(dst::T, src::T)` to copy the contents of `src` into `dst`;

* `vswap!{T}(x::T, y::T)` to exchange the contents of `x` and `y`;

* `vfill!{T}(x::T, alpha::Float)` to set all values of `x` with `alpha`;

* `vscale!{T}(x::T, alpha::Float)` to scale all values of `x` by `alpha`;

* `vdot{T}(x::T, y::{T})::Float` to compute the inner product of `x` and `y`,
  the result is expected to be a `Float`;

* `vcombine!{T}(dst::T, alpha::Float, x::T, beta::Float, y::T)` to perform
  `dst = alpha*x + beta*y`;

* `vproduct!{T}(dst::T, x::T, y::T)` stores the elementwise multiplication
  of `x` by `y` in `dst`.

The following methods may optionally be implemented:

* `vnorm2{T}(x::T)` to compute the Euclidean norm of `x`, if not provided, the
  default implementation is: `vnorm2(x) = sqrt(vdot(x, x))`;

* `vnorm1{T}(x::T)` to compute the L1 norm of `x`;

* `vnorminf{T}(x::T)` to compute the infinite norm of `x`;

* `update!{T}(dst::T, alpha::Float, x::T)` to perform `dst += alpha*x`, the
  default implementation is:
  ```julia
  update!{T}(dst::T, alpha::Float, x::T) = vcombine!(dst, 1.0, dst, alpha, x)`
  ```

* `vcombine!{T}(dst::T, alpha::Float, x::T, beta::Float, y::T, gamma::Float, z::T)`
  to perform `dst = alpha*x + beta*y + gamma*z` the default implementation is:
  ```julia
  function vcombine!{T}(dst::T, alpha::Float, x::T,
                        beta::Float, y::T, gamma::Float, z::T)
        vcombine!(dst, alpha, x, beta, y)
        update!(dst, gamma, z)
  end
  ```

OptimPackNextGen provides reasonably optimized implementations of these methods
for Julia `Array` types.  So OptimPackNextGen can be used out-of-the box if
your unknowns are stored in the form of Julia arrays.  Otherwise, you'll have
to implement the above methods.

Note that `length`, `vcreate`, `vcopy!`, `vscale!` and `vfill!` are identical
or similar to methods already provided by Julia for its arrays but the
semantics is somewhat different.  For instance, compared to `vcopy!`, `copy!`
copies all the values of the source array, the elements of the destination may
have a different data type and the destination may have different dimensions
than the source (the only constraint is that the destination must have at least
as many elements as the source).

The following methods must be implemented (`S` is a floating-point scalar type
and `V` is the type of your variables):

* `vnorm1(x::V, y::V)`
* `vnorminf(x::V, y::V)`
* `vdot(x::V, y::V)`
* `vcreate(x::V)`
* `vcopy!(dst::V, src::V)`
* `vswap!(x::V, y::V)`
* `vfill!(x::V, alpha::S)`
* `vupdate!(dst::V, alpha::S, x::V)`
* `vproduct!(dst::V, x::V, y::V)`
* `vcombine!(dst::V, alpha::S, x::V, beta::S, y::V)`

The following methods have default based on other provided method but you may
consider implementing a more efficient version:

* `vnorm2(x::V, y::V)` defaults to `sqrt(vdot(x, y))`;
* `vscale!(dst::V, alpha::S)` defaults to `vscale!(dst, alpha, dst)`;
* `vscale!(dst::V, alpha::S, src::V)` defaults to
  `vcombine!(dst, alpha, src, 0, src)`;
* `vproduct!(dst::V, src::V)` defaults to `vproduct!(dst, dst, src)`;

In order to use bound constraint optimization, you must provide the following
methods (`F` is the type of object returned by `get_free_variables`):

* `project_variables`;
* `project_direction`;
* `get_free_variables`;
* `step_limits`;
* `vdot(sel::F, x::V, y::V)`
* `vupdate!(dst::V, sel::F, alpha::S, x::V)`
* `vproduct!(dst::V, sel::F, x::V, y::V)`
